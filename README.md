# Project1 - Cards against humanity

**Gameplay:**
Cards against Humanity is a turn based multi-player card game that can be played on mobile or web.
The default number of players is 5.
One player is the "deciding player", and draws a randomised black question card.
The other players are each dealt 5 potential answer cards, and chooses their favourite answer card in response to the question.
A player clicks "Deal answer cards" button to receive the answer cards, and clicks the same button to hide the answer cards from the other players.
All players get to choose their preferred answer card(s). 
Ensure that all answer cards are not hidden before clicking "Done Selecting" and passing the device or screen back to the deciding player.
The deciding player then chooses his/her favourite answer card, based on the answer cards submitted by the other players.
The player that submitted the chosen answer card wins the round and scores a point.
The round restarts with a new question card (click "Start Game") and all players (except for the deciding player) are dealt 5 new answer cards to respond to the new question.
The first player to reach 5 points win the game.

**Technologies used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Dom manipulation, event listeners, arrays storing the question cards and answer cards
